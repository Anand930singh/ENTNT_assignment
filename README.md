## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues or Limitations

- No real authentication or security (user data is hardcoded).
- Only login feature is there (no signup)
- Data loss if `localStorage` is cleared manually.
- No offline/online sync or backups.
- Role access is enforced only on the frontend (can be bypassed via dev tools).

## üí° Technical Decisions

- React Functional Components with Hooks for modern and clean code.
- `localStorage` used for data simulation per the project restriction.
- MUI components and External CSS (or your choice) for fast, utility-first styling.
- Form Validation with native HTML5 and custom feedback logic.
- Manual JSON structure created to seed the application on first load.
